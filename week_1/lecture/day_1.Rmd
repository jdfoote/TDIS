# Welcome to COM 495/6/7!

## Introductions

## About Me

## Dad Joke

- Why did the nearsighted man fall in the well?

> - He couldn't see that well!

# The Class

## Goals

> - Understand the role of narrative in interpreting and producing data analyses
> - Competently import, process, and prepare data for analysis in R
> - Produce beautiful, truthful visualizations in R
> - Critically analyze data visualizations and presentations
> - Craft compelling data presentations

## Why learn data storytelling skills?

<img class = 'fragment' src='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#/media/File:Ignaz_Semmelweis_1860.jpg' style = 'width:80%;' />

## Lots of reasons Semmelweis's findings were not accepted

> - No real theory of how "corpse particles" actually caused disease
> - Didn't fit in the "paradigm" of understanding
> - Doctors had to accept that they were the cause of thousands of deaths

## But he was also a bad data storyteller

## Data does not speak for itself
