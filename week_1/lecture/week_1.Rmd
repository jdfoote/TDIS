## Dad Joke

- Why did the nearsighted man fall in the well?

> - He couldn't see that well!

# The Class

## Goals

> - Understand the role of narrative in interpreting and producing data analyses
> - Competently import, process, and prepare data for analysis in R
> - Produce beautiful, truthful visualizations in R
> - Critically analyze data visualizations and presentations
> - Craft compelling data presentations

## Why learn data storytelling skills?

<aside class="notes">
This is Ignaz Semmelweis.

Austrian physician working as an OB in the 1840s.

2 clinics - one run by drs the other by nurses. Women begged to be admitted to the nurse-run facility.

Childbed fever ran rampant in the dr clinic - about 10% of women who gave birth there died

Another Dr. in the hospital and Semmelweis's friend Jakob Kolletschka was poked with a scalpel while helping a student perform an autopsy. Semmelweis realized that was the difference - the drs. performed autopsies, and something from the cadavers was making women sick. He instituted handwashing with chlorinated lime, and deaths plummeted.

He spent the rest of his life trying to convince others of the value of handwashing in increasingly desperate ways and eventually died in an insane asylum.

## Lots of reasons Semmelweis's findings were not accepted

> - No real theory of how "corpse particles" actually caused disease
> - Didn't fit in the "paradigm" of understanding
> - Doctors had to accept that they were the cause of thousands of deaths

## But he was also a bad data storyteller

## Data does not speak for itself

I'm not saying that this class will help you to avoid dying alone, but I'm also not *not* saying that

## About the class

> - Building a learning community
> - Discussions vs. lectures
> - Resolving confusion
> - Applications


## Discord Meetings

> - Tuesdays are "required"

> - Discussion questions due on Mondays (in Discord)
> - Random cold calling based on questions
>	- I will track whether you are prepared
> - Think, pair, share

## Grading

> - Self-assessment
>	- What are your goals?
> - I will track your progress and provide feedback
> - Four times you will discuss your progress and suggest the grade you are earning
>	- I will let you know when/if I disagree

## R

> - For much of the class, homework will be R assignments instead of discussion questions
> - Tuesday classes will review homework questions and confusions, Thursdays will be co-working
> - Please ask and answer questions in Discord!

## Exam

> - One exam
>	- Goal is to encourage self-accountability

## Final Project

> - Data presentation

## Project Milestones

> - Identify dataset
> - Proposal
> - Rough draft
> - Each stage includes a round of peer feedback
